            {b} The field must be made of either artificial or natural grass. The size of pitches is allowed to vary but must be within 100-130 yards long and 50-100 yards wide. The pitch must also be marked with a rectangular shape around the outside showing out of bounds, two six yard boxes, two 18 yard boxes and a centre circle. A spot for a penalty placed 12 yards out of both goals and centre circle must also be visible.
            {b} The ball must have a circumference of 58-61cm and be of a circular shape.
            {b} Each team can name up to 7 substitute players. Substitutions can be made at any time of the match with each team being able to make a maximum of 3 substitutions per side. In the event of all three substitutes being made and a player having to leave the field for injury the team will be forced to play without a replacement for that player.
            {b} Each game must include one referee and two assistant referee`s (linesmen). It`s the job of the referee to act as time keeper and make any decisions which may need to be made such as fouls, free kicks, throw ins, penalties and added on time at the end of each half. The referee may consult the assistant referees at any time in the match regarding a decision. It`s the assistant referee`s job to spot offside`s in the match (see below), throw ins for either team and also assist the referee in all decision making processes where appropriate.
            {b} If the game needs to head to extra time as a result of both teams being level in a match then 30 minutes will be added in the form of two 15 minute halves after the allotted 90 minutes.
            {b} If teams are still level after extra time then a penalty shootout must take place.
            {b} The whole ball must cross the goal line for it to constitute as a goal.
            {b} For fouls committed a player could receive either a yellow or red card depending on the severity of the foul; this comes down to the referee`s discretion. The yellow is a warning and a red card is a dismissal of that player. Two yellow cards will equal one red. Once a player is sent off then they cannot be replaced.
            {b} If a ball goes out of play off an opponent in either of the side lines then it is given as a throw in. If it goes out of play off an attacking player on the base line then it is a goal kick. If it comes off a defending player it is a corner kick.',

            {b} After the ball goes into a team`s half and they win possession back the ball must then make it back over the half way line within 10 seconds. If the ball fails to do so then a foul will be called and the ball will be turned over.
            {b} Each team has 24 seconds to at least shot at the basket. A shot constitutes either going in the basket or hitting the rim of the basket. If after the shot is taken and the ball fails to go in the basket then the shot clock is restarted for another 24 seconds.
            {b} The team trying to score a basket is called the offence whilst the team trying to prevent them from scoring is called the defence. The defence must do all they can to stop the offence from scoring by either blocking a shot or preventing a shot from being fired.

            {b} Fouls committed throughout the game will be accumulated and then when reached a certain number will be eventually be awarded as a free throw. A free throw involves one playerfrom the offensive team (the player fouled) to take a shot unopposed from the free throw line. Depending on where the foul was committed will depend on the number free throws a player gets.

If the team batting second in the bottom of the 9th inning are already ahead in points, then they do not need to complete their batting innings.

            {b} If the batter manages to hit the ball from the pitcher, they must make an effort to at least get to first base. They can then run to as many bases as they wish before being tagged out. Each base must be touched with some part of the batters body when running past.
            {b} A batter gets up to three strikes before getting out. A strike is deemed when a batter swings for a ball and misses it. The batter can leave the ball but, if it`s within a certain area (called the strike zone), then a strike will also be given. If four balls miss the strike zone and the batter does not swing their bat, they can walk to first base.

            {b} Players can be dismissed by either a strike out (referring to a batsman missing the ball three times), force out (when a player fails to make the base before the defensive player), fly out (when the ball is hit in the air and caught without it bouncing), and tag outs (where a defensive player with the ball tags the batsman with the ball all whilst they are running).',
